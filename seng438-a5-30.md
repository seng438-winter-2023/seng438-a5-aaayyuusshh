# Introduction

Reliability growth testing is the process of analyzing a piece of software’s performance over time, and stressing the system to potentially find weaknesses in the system’s design. In this lab, we will assess the reliability of a hypothetical system given its failure data collected from integration testing. In order to do this, we will use a Reliability Growth Assessment Tool (CASRE or SRTAT) to create and compare plots of the system’s failure rate and reliability.

Another objective of this lab is to assess reliability using a Reliability Demonstration Chart. A Reliability Demonstration Chart is an efficient way of checking whether a system’s actual Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) and Failure Rate meet the intended MTTF and Failure Rate. Similar to Reliability Growth testing, it is also done by collecting failure data at time intervals. To do this, we will need to use SRTAT or RDC-11.

By the end of this lab, we will have gained experience with Reliability Growth testing and using a Reliability Demonstration Chart. We will have also learned how to measure the failure rate, mean time to failure and reliability of a system by analyzing failure data. Ultimately, we will learn the benefits of such tools, and be able to apply them to our everyday lives and other software projects.

## Explain your evaluation and justification of how you decide the MTTFmin
- Before performing RDC testing and deciding the MTTF min, we picked the failure data set (CSR1) : this is equivalent to actually collecting failure data in a real world scenario.
- Discrimination Ratio (acceptable error in estimating failure intensity) is set to 2
- Customer Risk (probability the developer is willing to falsely say that a target failure is met when it is not) is set to 0.1 which is 10%.
- Developer Risk (probability that the developer is willing to falsely say that a target failure is not met when it is) is set to 0.1 which is 10%.
- Next, we decided on the target MTTF min (mean time to failure)
  - The target MTTF min is decided to be 0.1 failure/second 
  - This number was determined through trail and error testing of the failure data file. We picked the number that barely touched the accept region and picked that to be our MTTF min.
- Normalize the failure data based on the target MTTF and use the normalized failure data for RDC testing and analyze the trends.

## A discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of RDC

**Advantages:**
- A cost effective, versatile, and time effective way of analyzing reliability of  a system. 
- Provides relatively accurate failure rate data for a system.
- Effective in testing reliability of smaller systems.
- Takes into account the discrimination ratio, customer risk, and developer risk which leads to more accurate reliability results.

**Disadvantages:**
- Although, it indicates if a SUT is acceptable or not, it doesn’t provide an exact quantitative value to demonstrate the reliability of a SUT.
- RDC (especially the SRTAT tool used in this assignment) only accepts limited data types/file format which makes it restrictive to certain data types only.
- Not as effective in testing reliability of large scale systems.


# Comparison of Results

Reliability Growth Testing (RGT) and Reliability Demonstration Chart (RDC) results both show that the software's failure rate/reliability improved with continued testing. Reliability Growth Testing (RGT) demonstrated a gradual decrease in the cumulative failure rate which is indicative of increased reliability.  Similarly, Reliability Demonstration Chart (RDC) demonstrated an improvement in failure rate as the system moved from "continue" to "accept" regions, implying improved MTTF metrics over time. When analyzing the data, Reliability Demonstration Chart (RDC) also takes into account the discrimination ratio, customer risk, and developer risk. 

The conclusion of both RGT (Reliability Growth Testing) and RDC (Reliability Demo Chart) testing techniques were the same; both techniques classified the SUT (System under Test) to be reliable as testing is continued as time passes. RGT (Reliability Growth Testing) and RDC (Reliability Demo Chart) both indicate improved reliability over time, seen through slower cumulative failure rate increases and movement to the accept region.


# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques

**Similarities:**
- RGT (Reliability Growth Testing) and RDC (Reliability Demo Chart)  both use mathematical and statistical formulas to determine reliability of a system.
- RGT (Reliability Growth Testing) and RDC (Reliability Demo Chart) are both used during the Integration Testing step of the Software Testing Life Cycle.
- RGT (Reliability Growth Testing) and RDC (Reliability Demo Chart) are both based on inter failure times and target failure rate (or MTTF).
- RGT (Reliability Growth Testing) and RDC (Reliability Demo Chart) are both used to measure the reliability of the SUT (System under Test)
- RGT (Reliability Growth Testing) and RDC (Reliability Demo Chart) both aid in the decision making process of a system. (acceptance/rejection of a system)

**Differences:**
- RDC is based on inter failure times only and target failure rate (or MTTF).
- RGT is based on inter failure times and/or failure count and target failure rate (or MTTF).
- RDC  takes into account the discrimination ratio, customer risk, and developer risk when analyzing the failure data and determining reliability (accept/reject)
- RGT (Reliability Growth Testing) evaluates the reliability of a system over time (RGT is done through multiple iterations of testing), whereas, RDC (Reliability Demo Chart) evaluates the reliability of a system at a specific point in time (i.e., accept or reject the system after development is done)
- RDC (Reliability Demo Chart) often is performed on smaller systems as well as on systems with relatively less failure data. 


# How the team work/effort was divided and managed

For this lab, our group met in person to become accustomed with the required software for this lab. This proved to be difficult, as the reliability growth testing software wouldn’t load any of the provided datasets. After we figured out how to load them, we each had a chance to experiment with C-SFRAT and RDC-11 and SRTAT on each other’s machines, and divided up the work evenly. 

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

Out of all of the labs in this course, our group feels that we encountered the most difficulties in this one. As stated above, the reliability growth testing software would not load any of the provided datasets. This led to us having to translate the Word data into .csv files, which took a lot of time. The other challenge we encountered were the instructions themselves being unclear. In some instances, it was not clear how to move from one step to the next, and the steps themselves didn’t go into much detail. In the end however, we overcame these challenges through teamwork and trial and error.

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself

Overall, our group found that this lab was a good introduction to Reliability Growth Testing and using Reliability Demonstration Charts. However some parts took longer due to the vagueness of the instructions, leaving students to figure out a lot of stuff on their own. For next time, we suggest providing failure data files that can actually be opened in the reliability growth testing software, and perhaps clearer instructions on how to convert them if needed. It would also be helpful for students if documentation for the required softwares were provided.

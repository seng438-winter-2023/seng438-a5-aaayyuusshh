## Explain your evaluation and justification of how you decide the MTTFmin
- Before performing RDC testing and deciding the MTTF min, we picked the failure data set (CSR1) : this is equivalent to actually collecting failure data in a real world scenario.
- Discrimination Ratio (acceptable error in estimating failure intensity) is set to 2
- Customer Risk (probability the developer is willing to falsely say that a target failure is met when it is not) is set to 0.1 which is 10%.
- Developer Risk (probability that the developer is willing to falsely say that a target failure is not met when it is) is set to 0.1 which is 10%.
- Next, we decided on the target MTTF min (mean time to failure)
  - The target MTTF min is decided to be 0.1 failure/second 
  - This number was determined through trail and error testing of the failure data file. We picked the number that barely touched the accept region and picked that to be our MTTF min.
- Normalize the failure data based on the target MTTF and use the normalized failure data for RDC testing and analyze the trends.

## A discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of RDC

**Advantages:**
- A cost effective, versatile, and time effective way of analyzing reliability of  a system. 
- Provides relatively accurate failure rate data for a system.
- Effective in testing reliability of smaller systems.
- Takes into account the discrimination ratio, customer risk, and developer risk which leads to more accurate reliability results.

**Disadvantages:**
- Although, it indicates if a SUT is acceptable or not, it doesn’t provide an exact quantitative value to demonstrate the reliability of a SUT.
- RDC (especially the SRTAT tool used in this assignment) only accepts limited data types/file format which makes it restrictive to certain data types only.
- Not as effective in testing reliability of large scale systems.
